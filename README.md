Description
This is an HTML webpage with some CSS and JavaScript code. The webpage is a landing page for a healthcare service called Emer-health Services. The webpage has a header section with the Emer-health logo and a brief introduction about the service. The webpage also includes a form for patients to fill in their details and describe their condition.

The webpage has a JavaScript code that displays an alert message after 30 seconds of the page being loaded, which reminds the patients to wait for three minutes if their condition is critical before filling the form. After three minutes, another alert message appears, which informs the patient that they can wait further if they require a cover. If the patient does not require a cover, they are directed to the National Hospital Insurance Fund website.

The webpage also includes a side-panel that lists doctors' names, specialties, and contact numbers. This list is intended to be used in case the patient is in critical condition. Finally, the webpage has a footer section with contact details and social media links.
